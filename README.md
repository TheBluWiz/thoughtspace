  ## Description
  This is the server for a new social media platform. A client is already hard at work on their front end and asked me to build this spec to the interface they decided on. This was my first time using nested documents in NoSQL, so I'd love feedback on implementation/best practices. It is built using Express and MongoDB with Mongoose as an ORM.

  ## Installation
  This backend includes a package.json for node enviornments. Run 'npm i' from the root folder to install dependencies.
  ## Usage
  The code launches an express server charged with managing a NoSQL server. It allows creation, updating, and deleting users and their thoughts, as well as returning that information to the client.
